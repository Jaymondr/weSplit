# weSplit
This project in SwiftUI allows the user to split a bill, while taking into account the tip amount, and the number of people.

In this project I demonstrated knowledge about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections,
creating navigation views and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the @State and @FocusState property wrappers,
how to create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and how to create views in a loop using ForEach.
